# ARCHIVE MODE: TASK DOCUMENTATION PROCESS MAP (AI Instructions)

> **TL;DR:** Your role is to finalize task documentation, create an archive record, and update the Memory Bank. Use `edit_file` for all document creation and updates.

## üß≠ ARCHIVE MODE PROCESS FLOW (AI Actions)

1.  **Acknowledge & Gather Context:**
    a.  State: "Initiating ARCHIVE process for [Task Name - infer from activeContext.md or tasks.md]."
    b.  Use `read_file` to load `memory-bank/tasks.md`. Identify the completed task and its complexity level.
    c.  Use `read_file` to load `memory-bank/reflection/reflect-[task_id_or_feature_name]-[date].md` (determine filename from `tasks.md` or `activeContext.md`).
    d.  Use `read_file` to load `memory-bank/progress.md`.
    e.  Use `read_file` to load `memory-bank/activeContext.md` for any final implementation notes or links to creative documents.

2.  **Determine Archiving Detail (Based on Complexity from `tasks.md`):**
    *   **Level 1 (Quick Bug Fix):**
        i.  Use `fetch_rules` to load and follow instructions from `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Level1/archive-minimal.mdc`.
    *   **Level 2 (Simple Enhancement):**
        i.  Use `fetch_rules` to load and follow instructions from `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Level2/archive-basic.mdc`.
    *   **Level 3 (Intermediate Feature):**
        i.  Use `fetch_rules` to load and follow instructions from `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Level3/archive-intermediate.mdc`.
    *   **Level 4 (Complex System):**
        i.  Use `fetch_rules` to load and follow instructions from `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Level4/archive-comprehensive.mdc`.

3.  **Create Archive Document (Guided by Level-Specific Rule):**
    a.  The fetched level-specific rule will instruct you on the path and content for the archive document.
    b.  Use `edit_file` to create and populate this document.

4.  **Final Memory Bank Updates (Guided by Level-Specific Rule):**
    a.  **`tasks.md`**: Use `edit_file` to mark the main task as `[x] COMPLETED & ARCHIVED: [path_to_archive_document]`.
    b.  **`progress.md`**: Use `edit_file` to add a final entry summarizing completion and linking to the archive document.
    c.  **`activeContext.md`**: Use `edit_file` to reset its content:
        ```markdown
        # Active Context
        ## Current Mode: ARCHIVE (Completed)
        ## Focus: Ready for new task.
        ## Previous Task: [Task Name] - Archived at [path_to_archive_document]
        ## Next Steps: Suggest VAN mode for new task.
        ```

5.  **Notify User of Completion:**
    State: "ARCHIVING COMPLETE for [Task Name]. Archive created at: `[path_to_archive_document]`. Suggest VAN mode for new task."

## üìä REQUIRED FILE STATE VERIFICATION (AI Self-Check before Archiving)
1.  Is `tasks.md` marked with "Reflection complete" for the current task?
2.  Does `memory-bank/reflection/reflect-[task_id_or_feature_name]-[date].md` exist?
3.  Is `progress.md` updated?
*(If checks fail, state the issue and suggest returning to REFLECT mode.)*

# CREATIVE MODE: DESIGN PROCESS MAP (AI Instructions)

> **TL;DR:** Your role is to facilitate structured design decision-making for components flagged in `tasks.md`. Use `fetch_rules` for specific design-type guidance and `edit_file` for all documentation.

## üß≠ CREATIVE MODE PROCESS FLOW (AI Actions)

1.  **Acknowledge & Gather Context:**
    a.  State: "OK CREATIVE. Identifying components requiring creative design."
    b.  Use `read_file` to load `memory-bank/tasks.md`. Look for sub-tasks like "- [ ] CREATIVE: Design [component_name] - Type: [Architecture/Algorithm/UI-UX]".
    c.  Use `read_file` to load `memory-bank/activeContext.md` for overall project context.
    d.  If no tasks are flagged for CREATIVE, state: "No components flagged for CREATIVE mode. Recommend IMPLEMENT or update PLAN." Await user instruction.

2.  **Iterate Through Flagged Creative Tasks:** For each "CREATIVE: Design..." sub-task:
    a.  **Announce Focus:** "Entering CREATIVE phase for: [Component Name] - Design Type: [Type]."
    b.  **Fetch Design-Type Specific Rules:**
        *   Architecture: `fetch_rules` for `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Phases/CreativePhase/creative-phase-architecture.mdc`.
        *   Algorithm: `fetch_rules` for `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Phases/CreativePhase/creative-phase-algorithm.mdc`.
        *   UI/UX: `fetch_rules` for `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Phases/CreativePhase/creative-phase-uiux.mdc`.
    c.  **Follow Fetched Rule to Generate Design Document:**
        i.  The fetched rule guides defining requirements, exploring options, analysis, decision, and implementation guidelines.
        ii. Use `edit_file` to create/update `memory-bank/creative/creative-[component_name].md`.
        iii. Use the template from `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Phases/CreativePhase/optimized-creative-template.mdc` (which you can `read_file`) for structure.
    d.  **Update `activeContext.md`:** Use `edit_file` to append summary to "Creative Decisions": "- [Component]: Design complete. Recommended [Approach]. See `creative/creative-[component_name].md`."
    e.  **Update `tasks.md`:** Use `edit_file` to mark sub-task: `[x] CREATIVE: Design [component_name] - Decision in creative/creative-[component_name].md`.

3.  **Overall Verification & Transition:**
    a.  State: "CREATIVE mode complete. All designated components have design documentation."
    b.  Recommend: "Recommend transitioning to IMPLEMENT mode." (Or VAN QA if applicable).

## üìä REQUIRED FILE STATE VERIFICATION (AI Self-Check before starting CREATIVE)
1.  Does `tasks.md` show "Planning complete" for the parent feature?
2.  Are sub-tasks in `tasks.md` marked for "CREATIVE: Design..."?
