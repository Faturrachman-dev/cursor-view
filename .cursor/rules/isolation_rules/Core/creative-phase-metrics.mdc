# CREATIVE PHASE METRICS & QUALITY ASSESSMENT

> **TL;DR:** This document defines quality metrics and evaluation criteria for outputs generated during the Creative Phase (e.g., `creative-*.md` files). It serves as a guide for ensuring design decisions are well-documented, justified, and meet required standards. This rule is primarily for AI understanding of what constitutes a "good" creative output.

## ðŸ“Š METRICS OVERVIEW (Conceptual for AI)
*(Mermaid diagram for human reference)*
**Textual Guide for AI (When generating or reviewing creative phase documentation):**
A high-quality creative document (`memory-bank/creative/creative-[feature_name].md`) should demonstrate:

1.  **Documentation Quality:**
    *   Clear problem statement and objectives for the design.
    *   Well-defined requirements and constraints that the design addresses.
    *   Proper formatting, structure, and clarity.
2.  **Decision Coverage:**
    *   All significant design decisions for the component are identified and addressed.
    *   Dependencies and potential impacts are considered.
3.  **Option Analysis:**
    *   Multiple (2-3) viable design options were explored.
    *   Pros and cons for each option are clearly documented.
    *   Technical feasibility and resource implications were considered.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**
    *   The impact of the chosen design on the overall system, performance, security, and maintainability is assessed.
5.  **Verification & Justification:**
    *   The recommended design is clearly justified against requirements and trade-offs.
    *   Implementation guidelines are provided for the chosen design.

# Creative Phase Quality Assessment (Conceptual)

## 1. Documentation Quality
- Clear problem statement & objectives?
- Requirements & constraints listed?
- Well-structured & formatted?

## 2. Decision Coverage
- All key design aspects addressed?
- Dependencies noted?
- Impact considered?

## 3. Option Analysis
- Multiple options explored?
- Pros/cons for each documented?
- Feasibility/complexity assessed?

## 4. Impact Assessment (for chosen design)
- System/performance/security impact considered?

## 5. Justification & Guidelines
- Recommended design clearly justified?
- Implementation guidelines provided?
