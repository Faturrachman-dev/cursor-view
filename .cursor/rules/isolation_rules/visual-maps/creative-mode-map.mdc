# CREATIVE MODE: DESIGN PROCESS MAP (AI Instructions)

> **TL;DR:** Your role is to facilitate structured design decision-making for components flagged in `tasks.md`. Use `fetch_rules` for specific design-type guidance and `edit_file` for all documentation.

## ðŸ§­ CREATIVE MODE PROCESS FLOW (AI Actions)

1.  **Acknowledge & Gather Context:**
    a.  State: "OK CREATIVE. Identifying components requiring creative design."
    b.  Use `read_file` to load `memory-bank/tasks.md`. Look for sub-tasks like "- [ ] CREATIVE: Design [component_name] - Type: [Architecture/Algorithm/UI-UX]".
    c.  Use `read_file` to load `memory-bank/activeContext.md` for overall project context.
    d.  If no tasks are flagged for CREATIVE, state: "No components flagged for CREATIVE mode. Recommend IMPLEMENT or update PLAN." Await user instruction.

2.  **Iterate Through Flagged Creative Tasks:** For each "CREATIVE: Design..." sub-task:
    a.  **Announce Focus:** "Entering CREATIVE phase for: [Component Name] - Design Type: [Type]."
    b.  **Fetch Design-Type Specific Rules:**
        *   Architecture: `fetch_rules` for `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Phases/CreativePhase/creative-phase-architecture.mdc`.
        *   Algorithm: `fetch_rules` for `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Phases/CreativePhase/creative-phase-algorithm.mdc`.
        *   UI/UX: `fetch_rules` for `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Phases/CreativePhase/creative-phase-uiux.mdc`.
    c.  **Follow Fetched Rule to Generate Design Document:**
        i.  The fetched rule guides defining requirements, exploring options, analysis, decision, and implementation guidelines.
        ii. Use `edit_file` to create/update `memory-bank/creative/creative-[component_name].md`.
        iii. Use the template from `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Phases/CreativePhase/optimized-creative-template.mdc` (which you can `read_file`) for structure.
    d.  **Update `activeContext.md`:** Use `edit_file` to append summary to "Creative Decisions": "- [Component]: Design complete. Recommended [Approach]. See `creative/creative-[component_name].md`."
    e.  **Update `tasks.md`:** Use `edit_file` to mark sub-task: `[x] CREATIVE: Design [component_name] - Decision in creative/creative-[component_name].md`.

3.  **Overall Verification & Transition:**
    a.  State: "CREATIVE mode complete. All designated components have design documentation."
    b.  Recommend: "Recommend transitioning to IMPLEMENT mode." (Or VAN QA if applicable).

## ðŸ“Š REQUIRED FILE STATE VERIFICATION (AI Self-Check before starting CREATIVE)
1.  Does `tasks.md` show "Planning complete" for the parent feature?
2.  Are sub-tasks in `tasks.md` marked for "CREATIVE: Design..."?
*(If checks fail, state issue and suggest PLAN mode.)*
