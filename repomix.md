Order of Refining .mdc files:
Start with the Core rules, especially command-execution.mdc and file-verification.mdc, as these define fundamental operations.
Then, refine the main mode orchestrator maps (visual-maps/*-mode-map.mdc and van-qa-main.mdc), ensuring they correctly use fetch_rules to call other .mdc files and adhere to the refined core principles.
Next, refine the Level-specific and Phase-specific .mdc files, ensuring their detailed instructions align with the refined core rules and orchestrators.
Finally, review utility .mdc files.
