Okay, I understand. You've finalized `info.md` for your "CursorView" project, and now you want me to generate a Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on that `info.md`. This PRD will be for an AI, presumably to help with tasks related to the CursorView project itself (like documentation, feature brainstorming, or understanding its architecture, as hinted by your request for visual suggestions).

I will structure this PRD to be clear, comprehensive, and actionable for an AI assistant. It will draw directly from the excellent details you've provided in `info.md`.

Here is the Product Requirements Document for **CursorView: AI-Powered Chat Session Explorer**:

*   **Your Role in Project:** Lead Developer & Maintainer
*   **Project Links:**
    *   GitHub: `https://github.com/Faturrachman-dev/cursor-view`
    *   Hosted Web-App: `[hosted web-app link]` (To be provided by Faturrachman if available)

**3. Project Goals & Objectives (of CursorView)**

The primary goals of the CursorView project are to:

*   Provide Cursor AI users with a superior interface for browsing, managing, and searching their chat session histories.
*   Enable comprehensive export of chat sessions, including detailed agent interactions like Model Context Protocol (MCP) calls and tool usage.
*   Empower developers to extract actionable insights from their AI coding conversations through integrated AI analysis, helping them optimize their prompting techniques and overall workflow with Cursor AI.
*   Enhance the overall "vibe-coding" experience by making past AI interactions more accessible, understandable, and useful.

**4. Target Audience (for CursorView)**

The primary users of CursorView are:

*   Developers who actively use the Cursor AI IDE for coding and AI-assisted tasks.
*   Users who generate a significant number of chat sessions and need better tools for organization and review.
*   Developers interested in analyzing and improving their interaction patterns with AI coding assistants.
*   Teams that might want to share or archive specific AI-assisted development sessions.

**5. Problem Statement / User Needs Addressed**

CursorView addresses the following challenges faced by Cursor AI users:

1.  **Limited Native UI:** Developers need a more robust, visually intuitive, and feature-rich way to browse, search, and manage their extensive chat session histories than the current native Cursor UI provides. Existing limitations affect search, organization, and overall user experience.
2.  **Incomprehensive Export:** Users lack the ability to comprehensively export full Cursor chat sessions, especially those including complex data like MCP interactions, tool calls, and outputs from updated agent functionalities. This hinders offline review, knowledge sharing, and archival.
3.  **Difficulty in Extracting Insights:** Developers struggle to extract actionable insights from their AI coding conversations. They lack tools to analyze prompt effectiveness, identify patterns in AI responses, or understand their own interaction preferences to optimize future AI collaboration and "vibe-coding" workflows.

**6. Proposed Solution: CursorView**

CursorView solves these problems through the following key solution components:

1.  **Centralized Web Application:** An elegant and intuitive web application allowing users to seamlessly browse, search, and manage all their Cursor AI chat sessions aggregated across multiple projects from a single interface.
2.  **Detailed & Transparent Chat View:** Meticulous presentation of each conversation, including rich metadata such as session origin (database vector location), project context, timestamps, and a clear display of MCP interactions and agent tool calls, ensuring full conversational transparency.
3.  **Integrated AI-Powered Analysis:** An integrated AI assistant (leveraging RAG techniques with newer AI models like Deepseek, Qwen) analyzes chat content. This provides users with valuable insights into their prompting techniques, AI response patterns, and personal interaction preferences, empowering them to optimize their future AI-assisted coding workflows.

**7. Key Features & Highlights**

1.  **AI-Powered Conversation Analysis:** An integrated RAG agent provides users with insights on their prompt effectiveness and personal interaction patterns within their Cursor chats, helping them understand and improve their "vibe-coding" workflow.
2.  **Comprehensive Chat Export:** Offers full export capabilities for chat sessions, including detailed MCP interactions, tool calls, and agent messages. This is designed to be compatible with the latest Cursor agent features, ensuring no loss of critical information.
3.  **Enhanced Visualization & Readability:** Delivers a modern, clean, and intuitive user interface for a superior chat log viewing experience compared to the native Cursor interface, making it easier to navigate and digest information.
4.  **Multi-Project Chat Dashboard:** Provides a unified view for managing chat sessions from different projects in one place.
5.  **Rich Metadata Display:** Clearly presents relevant session metadata, including database locations, project context, and full agent/tool communication logs.

**8. Technical Specifications**

*   **Backend:** Python (Flask), SQLite
*   **Frontend:** React, JavaScript (ES6+), Material-UI (UI library), Axios (for API calls)
*   **Data Handling:** JSON, Markdown
*   **AI/LLM Integration:** Newer AI models (e.g., Deepseek, Qwen), RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Techniques for the integrated AI assistant.
*   **DevOps/Tooling:** Git, GitHub, Vite (for frontend build tooling).

**9. Expected Outcomes & Impact (for Users of CursorView)**

1.  **Enhanced Developer Productivity:** Users will experience a significantly improved UX for reviewing past AI interactions, making it faster to find information, recall context, and learn from previous coding sessions.
2.  **Complete Conversational Records & Knowledge Preservation:** Enables comprehensive export of chat sessions, including vital MCP and tool call data. This facilitates thorough offline analysis, creation of persistent documentation, or team knowledge sharing.
3.  **Actionable Workflow Optimization:** The integrated AI delivers personalized insights that help users refine their prompting strategies and interaction patterns with Cursor AI, leading to more effective and efficient AI-assisted coding.
4.  **Improved "Vibe-Coding" Experience:** By making AI interactions more transparent and analyzable, CursorView helps users understand and optimize their unique collaborative style with AI.

**10. Visual Assets**

*   **Existing Visuals Planned by Developer:**
    *   Screenshots showcasing the User Interface (UI).
    *   System design diagrams illustrating the application's architecture.
    *   A conceptual thumbnail for branding (optional).
*   **Request for AI Assistant (Based on this PRD):**
    *   Please suggest ideal specific visuals for this project's portfolio entry or documentation. Consider:
        *   **Key UI Screenshots:** Which specific screens or UI elements would be most impactful to showcase (e.g., the chat list dashboard, the detailed chat view with MCP calls highlighted, the AI insights panel)?
        *   **System Architecture Diagram:** What key components and data flows should a simplified architecture diagram for this project emphasize to be easily understood?
        *   **Modern Thumbnail Concept:** Suggest a theme or visual elements for a modern, tech-forward thumbnail that represents "CursorView: AI-Powered Chat Session Explorer." Consider incorporating elements that hint at "viewing," "AI," "chat," and "insights."
