# Current Tasks

## Project Setup Tasks
- [x] Initialize memory-bank structure
- [x] Set up development environment
- [x] Review existing code
- [x] Identify improvement areas


## Bug Fix Tasks
- [x] Fix JSON export functionality (404 error when requesting /api/chat/{id}/export?format=json) **[ARCHIVED]**
  - [x] Investigate backend server.py export_chat function
  - [x] Debug why specific chat IDs are not found during export
  - [x] Verify frontend export request in ChatDetail.js

- [x] Fix Delete Chat 404 Error (when deleting chat from UI) **[COMPLETED]**
  - [x] Investigate backend server.py delete_chat function
  - [x] Update function to use correct session_id pattern
  - [x] Test the solution and verify it works


### Implementation Notes
- Fixed the export_chat function in server.py to use the correct pattern for finding sessions by ID
- Changed from checking chat['session']['composerId'] to checking chat.get('session_id')
- Added detailed logging to help with debugging
- Used target_session_id parameter for more efficient extraction

## Documentation Tasks
- [x] Create comprehensive server.py documentation **[ARCHIVED]**
  - [x] Create architectural overview
  - [x] Document API endpoints
  - [x] Document database structure
  - [x] Detail bug fix implementation

## Code Fix Implementation

Modify the export_chat function in server.py (around line 1018) to use the same pattern as get_chat:

1. Change from checking chat['session']['composerId'] to checking chat.get('session_id')
2. Add detailed logging for the matching process
3. Pass target_session_id to extract_chats for more efficient lookup

The modified export_chat function should be similar to get_chat (line 874) which already works correctly.

## Fixed Task: Delete Chat 404 Error

### Task ID: DELETE-404-FIX
**Severity:** Medium  
**Type:** Bug Fix  
**Status:** Completed  
**Assigned:** Current user

### Description
When attempting to delete a chat from the chat history, a 404 error occurs with the message "Chat not found". This prevents users from managing their chat history effectively.

### Error Details
- DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/chat/a767a74e-492b-45b0-ae42-eb4e29dc2d13 404 (NOT FOUND)
- Error message: "Chat not found"
- Error occurs in ChatList.js during the delete operation

### Root Cause Analysis
The `delete_chat` function in server.py uses a different approach to finding the chat by ID compared to the `get_chat` and `export_chat` functions:

1. **Incorrect approach in delete_chat:**
   ```python
   # Check for a matching composerId safely
   if 'session' in chat and chat['session'] and isinstance(chat['session'], dict):
       if chat['session'].get('composerId') == session_id:
           chat_to_delete = chat
           break
   ```

2. **Correct approach used in get_chat and export_chat:**
   ```python
   # Check for direct session_id match in the chat object
   if chat.get('session_id') == session_id:
       # Process chat...
   ```

The extracted chat objects from `extract_chats()` store the session ID directly as `session_id` at the root level, not under a nested `session.composerId` property.

### Implementation Plan
1. Modify the `delete_chat` function in server.py to use the same pattern for finding chats by ID:
   ```python
   # Replace nested session.composerId check with direct session_id check
   if chat.get('session_id') == session_id:
       chat_to_delete = chat
       break
   ```

2. Update related composer_id extraction code in the delete_chat function as needed

3. Test the fix by:
   - Starting the server locally
   - Navigating to the chat list
   - Attempting to delete a chat
   - Verifying successful deletion without errors

### Fix Implemented
The changes made to fix the issue:
1. Updated the `delete_chat` function to use `chat.get('session_id')` instead of the nested property access
2. Added detailed logging for the specific session to help with debugging
3. Simplified the composer_id extraction to use session_id directly

### Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Users can successfully delete chats from the UI
- ✅ No 404 errors appear when deleting chats
- ✅ Server logs show successful chat deletion
- ✅ Deleted chats are permanently removed from the database

### Progress
- ✅ Root cause identified
- ✅ Solution approach determined
- ✅ Implement the fix
- ✅ Test the solution
- ✅ Update documentation

### Dependencies
- None

### Notes
This issue was similar to a previous bug with the JSON export functionality, where the same inconsistent property access pattern was the root cause. The fix follows a similar approach to the export_chat fix that was previously implemented.
