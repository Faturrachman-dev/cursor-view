# Current Tasks

## Project Setup Tasks
- [x] Initialize memory-bank structure
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Review existing code
- [ ] Identify improvement areas


## Bug Fix Tasks
- [ ] Fix JSON export functionality (404 error when requesting /api/chat/{id}/export?format=json)
  - [ ] Investigate backend server.py export_chat function
  - [ ] Debug why specific chat IDs are not found during export
  - [ ] Verify frontend export request in ChatDetail.js


### Detailed Implementation Plan
1. Modify server.py's export_chat function (around line 1018):
   - Use the same pattern as get_chat for finding sessions by ID
   - Replace the check for chat['session']['composerId'] with chat.get('session_id')
   - Add detailed logging to trace the chat lookup process
2. Check for any other inconsistencies between get_chat and export_chat implementations
3. Test both HTML and JSON export formats
4. Verify the fix in the browser

## Code Fix Implementation

Modify the export_chat function in server.py (around line 1018) to use the same pattern as get_chat:

1. Change from checking chat['session']['composerId'] to checking chat.get('session_id')
2. Add detailed logging for the matching process
3. Pass target_session_id to extract_chats for more efficient lookup

The modified export_chat function should be similar to get_chat (line 874) which already works correctly.
