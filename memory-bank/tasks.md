# Current Tasks

## Project Setup Tasks
- [x] Initialize memory-bank structure
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Review existing code
- [ ] Identify improvement areas


## Bug Fix Tasks
- [x] Fix JSON export functionality (404 error when requesting /api/chat/{id}/export?format=json)
  - [x] Investigate backend server.py export_chat function
  - [x] Debug why specific chat IDs are not found during export
  - [x] Verify frontend export request in ChatDetail.js


### Implementation Notes
- Fixed the export_chat function in server.py to use the correct pattern for finding sessions by ID
- Changed from checking chat['session']['composerId'] to checking chat.get('session_id')
- Added detailed logging to help with debugging
- Used target_session_id parameter for more efficient extraction

## Code Fix Implementation

Modify the export_chat function in server.py (around line 1018) to use the same pattern as get_chat:

1. Change from checking chat['session']['composerId'] to checking chat.get('session_id')
2. Add detailed logging for the matching process
3. Pass target_session_id to extract_chats for more efficient lookup

The modified export_chat function should be similar to get_chat (line 874) which already works correctly.
