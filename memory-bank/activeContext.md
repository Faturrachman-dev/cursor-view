## JSON Export Bug Fix Plan

### Issue
Users receive a 404 (Not Found) error when attempting to export chat history as JSON using the format=json parameter.

### Analysis
After comparing the frontend request in ChatDetail.js with the server export_chat route in server.py, I've identified the following issues:

1. The backend export_chat function is checking 'session' -> 'composerId' which doesn't match how chat data is stored in memory/returned from extract_chats()
2. There's an inconsistency between how session_id is stored and accessed in regular chat requests vs. export requests
3. The get_chat endpoint uses direct session_id matching, while export_chat uses a nested structure


### Solution Plan
1. Modify the export_chat function to use the same pattern as get_chat for finding sessions by ID
2. Ensure consistent use of session_id property across all route handlers
3. Add detailed logging to track the chat lookup process
4. Test the solution with both HTML and JSON export formats

## Documentation Development

Created a comprehensive documentation suite for Cursor View server.py, including:

- Main server documentation with architecture, endpoints, and deployment guidelines
- Detailed code reference for all main functions
- Database structure documentation
- Specific documentation for the JSON export bug fix implementation

This documentation will help with future maintenance and onboarding of new developers.\
