## Task Complexity Assessment
- Task: Fix 404 error when deleting a chat
- Determined Complexity: Level 1 - Quick Bug Fix
- Rationale: This is a single, isolated bug fix that involves changing a specific function (delete_chat) to use the correct property path for session ID. The fix is straightforward and does not impact multiple components or require architectural changes.

## Error Analysis
### 404 Error When Deleting Chat
**Problem:** Users receive a 404 (Not Found) error when attempting to delete a chat. Error details:
- DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/chat/a767a74e-492b-45b0-ae42-eb4e29dc2d13 404 (NOT FOUND)
- Error message: "Chat not found"

**Root Cause Identified:**
1. The `delete_chat` function uses a different property path to locate the chat compared to other endpoints:
   - `delete_chat` looks for: `chat['session']['composerId'] == session_id`
   - `get_chat` and `export_chat` look for: `chat.get('session_id') == session_id`

2. The chat data structure from `extract_chats()` uses `session_id` directly on the chat object, not nested under a `session` property.

**Solution Plan:**
1. Modify the `delete_chat` function to use the same pattern as `get_chat` for finding sessions by ID
2. Ensure consistent use of session_id property across all route handlers

- Task complexity assessed as Level 1 (Quick Bug Fix)
- Ready for IMPLEMENT mode

## JSON Export Bug Fix Plan

### Issue
Users receive a 404 (Not Found) error when attempting to export chat history as JSON using the format=json parameter.

### Analysis
After comparing the frontend request in ChatDetail.js with the server export_chat route in server.py, I've identified the following issues:

1. The backend export_chat function is checking 'session' -> 'composerId' which doesn't match how chat data is stored in memory/returned from extract_chats()
2. There's an inconsistency between how session_id is stored and accessed in regular chat requests vs. export requests
3. The get_chat endpoint uses direct session_id matching, while export_chat uses a nested structure

### Solution Plan
1. Modify the export_chat function to use the same pattern as get_chat for finding sessions by ID
2. Ensure consistent use of session_id property across all route handlers
3. Add detailed logging to track the chat lookup process
4. Test the solution with both HTML and JSON export formats

## Documentation Development

Created a comprehensive documentation suite for Cursor View server.py, including:

- Main server documentation with architecture, endpoints, and deployment guidelines
- Detailed code reference for all main functions
- Database structure documentation
- Specific documentation for the JSON export bug fix implementation

This documentation will help with future maintenance and onboarding of new developers.

## JSON Export Bug Fix Implementation

The JSON export bug has been successfully fixed and implemented. The solution involved:

1. Modifying the `export_chat` function in `server.py` to use the correct pattern for session ID lookup
2. Changing the lookup from checking `chat['session']['composerId']` to using `chat.get('session_id')`
3. Adding detailed logging to make future debugging easier
4. Using the `target_session_id` parameter to make data extraction more efficient
5. Testing both HTML and JSON export formats to verify the fix works

The bug was caused by an inconsistency between how sessions are stored and accessed between different route handlers. The `get_chat` endpoint was using the correct pattern, while the `export_chat` endpoint was using a nested structure that didn't match how the data was actually stored.

The fix ensures that both endpoints use the same consistent pattern to look up sessions by ID.
