This will create the tasks folder and the initial task files (tasks folder will be created when parse-prd is run). The parse-prd tool will require a prd.txt file as input (typically found in the project root directory, scripts/ directory). You can create a prd.txt file by asking the user about their idea, and then using the scripts/example_prd.txt file as a template to genrate a prd.txt file in scripts/. You may skip all of this if the user already has a prd.txt file. You can THEN use the parse-prd tool to create the tasks. So: step 1 after initialization is to create a prd.txt file in scripts/prd.txt or confirm the user already has one. Step 2 is to use the parse-prd tool to create the tasks. Do not bother looking for tasks after initialization, just use the parse-prd tool to create the tasks after creating a prd.txt from which to parse the tasks. You do NOT need to reinitialize the project to parse-prd.\\\\\\&quot;\\\\n  }\\\\n}\\&quot;}]}&quot;\n}</code></pre>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                </div>\n                ",
