      "content": "Based on my search, I've found several interesting intermediate-level Go game projects that would be excellent for learning purposes. Here are three standout options:\n\n## 1. PonGo: Multi-Room Pong/Breakout Hybrid\n\nThis project combines elements of Pong and Breakout in a real-time multiplayer game with a well-structured codebase that showcases several Go programming patterns:\n\n- **Actor Model pattern** for managing concurrency\n- **WebSocket implementation** for real-time communication\n- **Game physics** including collision detection and resolution\n- **Clean architecture** with separation of concerns\n- **Zero external dependencies**\n\nThe codebase includes comprehensive documentation explaining the architecture, game rules, and implementation details, making it ideal for learning. Repository: https://github.com/lguibr/pongo\n\n## 2. Project-Based Learning - Go Game Projects\n\nThe project-based learning repository includes several Go game projects:\n\n- **Create a Real Time Chat App with Golang, Angular 2, and WebSocket**\n- **Building a TCP Chat in Go**\n- **Building a BitTorrent client in Go**\n\nThese projects demonstrate network programming, concurrency, and protocol implementation - all valuable skills for game development. Repository: https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning#go\n\n## 3. Gopher Kombat\n\nA fighting game implementation in Go that showcases game loop design, state management, and real-time rendering techniques. Repository: https://github.com/gophergala/GopherKombat\n\nFor learning purposes, I'd recommend starting with the PonGo project. It has excellent documentation, a clean architecture that demonstrates Go's concurrency patterns, and implements core game development concepts without external dependencies. The code is well-structured and includes comprehensive explanations of both the game mechanics and implementation details."

Developers can use these as a roadmap to build the project incrementally, following the Actor Model architecture pattern and implementing the necessary game mechanics.\n\nWould you like me to create any additional planning documents or expand on a specific aspect of the project?"

The actor model provides a solid foundation for building the multiplayer functionality. The next major step would be to implement the WebSocket networking layer to allow clients to connect to the game."
